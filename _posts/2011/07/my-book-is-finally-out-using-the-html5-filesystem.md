*Until now, web applications have been unable to organize binary data
into a hierarchy of folders. That has changed with the advent of HTML5.
With this book, you'll learn how to provide your applications with a
true file system that enables them to create, read, and write files ands
folders in a sandboxed section of the user's local filesystem. Author
Eric Bidelman provides several techniques and complete code examples for
working with the HTML5 Filesystem API.*
